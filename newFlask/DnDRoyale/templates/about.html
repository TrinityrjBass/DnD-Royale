<h2>Motive</h2>
<p>
    D&D is an amazing game, but encounters can get tedious when they are not a challenge. Conversely, too
    much of a challenge leads to a dissapointing series of GM fiats or, worse, a total party kill, a
    scenario to avoid as it is disappointing for all or worse. Therefore a correct balance is needed. As
    a result the GM guide has a table that can be used to calculate how hard an encounter is, which is
    not overly accurate. I have been in too many encounters that on paper should have been deadly, while
    on the table have been a walk in the park. The reason for this is that a single value cannot
    represent the strength of a party.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, to address and <a href="#links">analyse</a> this and <a href="#links">
        to trial new
        weapons
    </a>, I wrote a <a href="#links">python script</a> to simulate battles.
</p>
<h2>But, How does it Work?</h2>
<p>
    The script empirically simulates a specified number of repeats of an encounter (<i>i.e.</i> 1,000
    times) in order to gain the probability of victory of defeat. damage and hp are not the sole factor
    in determining how an encounter may swing, therefore it may be impossible to predict with calculus,
    hence the simulation.
</p>
<h3><i class="fas fa-chess-board"></i> Assumptions</h3>
<p>
    There are may factors involved, one of which is strategy, which is encoded here with a set of
    assumptions.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        One targets an alive enemy with lowest hp (tag: "weakest"). Alternatives modes are random or
        that with highest average damage (tag: "fiercesomest")
    </li>
    <li>One heals only when there is no chance of wastage and one heals the most wonded character</li>
    <li>
        One uses net-throwing, grappling and other fancy moves only when there is turn economy &mdash;
        that is, one's team outnumbers the other.
    </li>
    <li>If there is turn economy and one is taking all the damage, one dodges.</li>
    <li>Some minor rules that make no difference</li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="far fa-chess-board"></i> Gridlessness</h3>
<p>
    This code does not take into account space. That means it assumes tactics on a grid don't matter:
    this is clearly wrong, but it is a lesser evil that encoding a <a href="#link">
        lot of behavioral
        rules
    </a> that are not obeyed in game &mdash;every group has a muchkin who will dive infront of
    a wizard's AoE just to kill stuff&mdash; or rules to solve non-trivial situations &mdash;player
    takes a 30 minute turn. Thanks to the many iterations, machine learning could be adopted making it a
    function minimisation problem, but it is overkill as no player is such a master strategist.
</p>
<h3><i class="far fa-wand-magic"></i>Spell-list</h3>
<p>
    Spell-budgeting troubles players, therefore there is not much spellcasting, bar for a handful of
    cantrips.
</p>
<h2>More</h2>
<p>
    This is the webserver version of a python script that is a lot more complex and customisable, such as
    running multiple analyses changing on parameter or running a single button and getting the verbose
    description of the battle. For technical reasons, the simulations are limited to 1,000 battles
    (encounters) and no custom spells are allowed as spells are encoded as method references which might
    lead to vulnerability.
